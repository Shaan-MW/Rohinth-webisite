As part of Team PHOENIX, which included members from Indonesia, Mongolia, Bangladesh, and Togo, I had the opportunity to explore diverse environmental challenges and solutions from home. We tackled several tasks, including sharing our countries' cultures and environmental issues, creating a virtual campaign titled "𝐙𝐞𝐫𝐨 𝐇𝐮𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐫, 𝐎𝐧𝐞 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐚𝐭 𝐚 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞" to combat food waste, and developing a climate action poster. We also produced recap and performance videos showcasing our journey.
